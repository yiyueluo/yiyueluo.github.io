Manual Fabrication Procedures
1. Refer to material list and prepare materials. 
2. Cut pressure-sensitive sheet into desired shape.
3. Cut 2 pieces of thin adhesive into desired shape.
4. Align horizontal electrodes on one of the thin adhesive.
5. Attach the adhesive with aligned electrodes on one side of the pressure-sensitive film.
6. Align horizontal electrodes on the other piece of thin adhesive.
7. Attach the adhesive with aligned electrodes on the other side of the pressure-sensitive film.
8. Carefully remove the cover of adhesive, and attach the thin plastic sheet on top of it for insulation.
9. Repeat for the other side. 
10. Make electrical connection between the aligend vertical/horizontal electrodes with 2 sets of ribbon cables.
11. Connect the ribbon cable with the readout circuit using the connector.
